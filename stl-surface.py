# Generate a 3D model based on a 2D equation

# The model will be rectangular with a flat base. The top surface is based on
# a provided equation in "surface_function". The file name can be set with the
# output_filename variable. The x and y width of the model and the grid spacing
# is defined by the following parameters.

# x_spacing
# y_spacing
# x_number_of_points
# y_number_of_points

# There may be a warning that model isn't closed. Most likely this is an error
# caused by the way numpy-stl tests the model. This usually only happens on
# models with a large number of faces. Ignore this warning but check the model
# to be sure.
